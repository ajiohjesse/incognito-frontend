          <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 10th Feb, 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incognito is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
          explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the
          application.
        </p>

        <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          Incognito does not collect, store, or process any personal data. Users
          are identified solely by their browsers, and no sign-up or sign-in is
          required.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Anonymous Messaging</h2>
        <p>
          All messages sent through Incognito are anonymous. We do not track or
          store the content of messages or the identities of users.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          Users can delete their accounts at any time. This action is
          irreversible and removes all associated data from our systems.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Incognito does not integrate with third-party services that collect or
          process user data.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect the app from unauthorized
          access or breaches. However, no system is completely secure, and we
          cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will
          be posted on this page.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>
